# Enigma-Machine-Emulator
A virtual emulation of the Enigma machine,used by Germans in WW2 for message encryption.
By using the same secret(to adversaries) rotor configurations, encrypted text transforms 
into the original message ; while each rotor upon completing a full cycle kicks the next 
rotor to move having as a result a different mapping on the letter's output. 

TO - DO : Fix menu load-save tabs.
